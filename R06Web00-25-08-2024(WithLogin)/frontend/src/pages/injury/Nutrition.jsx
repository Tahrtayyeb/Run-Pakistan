                The Science of Nutrition for Running Performance
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Running performance is heavily influenced by nutrition. Research has shown that proper fueling can significantly impact endurance, speed, and recovery. A study by Thomas et al. (2016) in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that carbohydrate intake before and during exercise can improve performance in events lasting longer than 90 minutes.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Carbohydrates: The Runner's Primary Fuel</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Carbohydrates are the body's preferred source of energy during high-intensity exercise like running. They're stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen, which is rapidly depleted during long or intense runs. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that endurance athletes consume 5-7 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight daily, increasing to 7-10 g/kg during intense training periods.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Protein: Essential for Recovery and Adaptation</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                While carbohydrates fuel performance, protein is crucial for recovery and adaptation. A meta-analysis by Morton et al. (2018) in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that protein intake of 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day can maximize muscle protein synthesis and aid in recovery for athletes.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Fats: The Endurance Runner's Friend</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Healthy fats play a vital role in endurance running, especially for ultra-distance events. They provide a concentrated source of energy and help absorb fat-soluble vitamins. The International Olympic Committee recommends that athletes consume 20-35% of their total calories from fat.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Running Performance</h2>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Pre-Run Nutrition</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Eating before a run is crucial to top off glycogen stores and maintain blood glucose levels. A study by Ormsbee et al. (2014) found that consuming a meal rich in low-glycemic index carbohydrates 2-3 hours before exercise can improve endurance performance.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>Consume 1-4 g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight, 1-4 hours before running</li>
                <li>Choose easily digestible foods to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort</li>
                <li>Include a small amount of protein to help prevent muscle breakdown</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">During-Run Nutrition</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                For runs lasting longer than 90 minutes, consuming carbohydrates during exercise can significantly improve performance. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends 30-60 g of carbohydrates per hour for events lasting 1-2.5 hours, and up to 90 g/hour for longer events.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Post-Run Recovery Nutrition</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The post-run recovery window is crucial for replenishing glycogen stores and initiating muscle repair. Consuming a combination of carbohydrates and protein within 30 minutes to 2 hours after a run can accelerate recovery and reduce muscle soreness.
              </p>

              <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row mb-8">
                <div className="md:w-1/2 md:pr-4">
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    A systematic review by Kerksick et al. (2017) recommends consuming 1.2 g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight and 0.25-0.3 g of protein per kg of body weight immediately after exercise for optimal recovery. Some excellent post-run recovery options include:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                    <li>Greek yogurt with berries and granola</li>
                    <li>Whole grain toast with peanut butter and banana</li>
                    <li>Smoothie made with milk, fruit, and protein powder</li>
                    <li>Chicken or tofu stir-fry with brown rice</li>
                  </ul>

              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Hydration: The Often Overlooked Nutrient</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Proper hydration is crucial for running performance and safety. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, increased perceived exertion, and in severe cases, heat illness. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>Drink 5-7 mL/kg of body weight 4 hours before exercise</li>
                <li>During exercise, drink to prevent &gt;2% body weight loss</li>
                <li>After exercise, replace 150% of fluid losses</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Fueling Your Running Journey</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Optimal nutrition is a powerful tool in every runner's arsenal. By understanding the science behind nutritional needs and implementing evidence-based strategies, you can significantly enhance your running performance, speed up recovery, and maintain overall health. Remember, individual needs may vary, so it's essential to experiment with different approaches and consult with a sports nutritionist to develop a personalized nutrition plan that works best for you.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As you fine-tune your nutrition strategy, you'll likely notice improvements in your energy levels, endurance, and recovery times. Embrace the process of learning about your body's needs and enjoy the journey of becoming a stronger, more resilient runner through the power of proper nutrition.
