                According to World Athletics, Kelvin Kiptum was born on December 2nd, 1999. His childhood was spent in the village of Chepkorio, situated at an altitude of 2600 meters. As the only child of his parents, he spent much of his childhood herding family cattle. It was during this time, while he observed trail runners in the forest, that he began to follow them barefoot.

                At the age of 13, he initiated his running career by participating in a half marathon in Kenya, where he finished in 12th place. Over time, he competed in many half marathons and races, culminating in his debut international marathon in December 2022 at Valencia. There, he pulled off an upset by finishing in 2 hours, 1 minute, and 53 seconds, the fourth fastest time ever recorded. Remarkably, he achieved negative splits, breaking the course record by a minute and becoming the third man to break the two-hour, two-minute milestone, a feat previously achieved only by Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In April 2023, at the London Marathon, he shattered the course record, completing the marathon in 2 hours, 1 minute, and 25 seconds, a mere 16 seconds slower than the world record at that time.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Later that year, at the Chicago Marathon in October 2023, at the age of 23, he ran the fastest marathon ever recorded by any athlete, finishing in just 2 hours and 35 seconds. He smashed the world record by 34 seconds and the course record by 3 minutes, astonishingly achieving negative splits. His performance in the challenging Chicago Marathon sparked hope for a sub-2-hour marathon in the near future.

                Regarding his training, following his record-breaking performances, his coach provided insight into Kiptumâ€™s regimen, stating that the athlete runs 250 to 280 kilometers (155 to 173 miles) per week, an astounding figure for any athlete. Kiptum ran three of the seven fastest marathons in history.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Tragically, Kiptum and his coach were involved in a car accident on February 11th, 2024, while returning home. Four men who had met the athlete four days prior to the accident were later detained during the investigation.
