                <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The 80/20 Rule for Runners</h1>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The 80/20 rule is a training principle that suggests dividing your training intensity into two main zones: 80% low-intensity and 20% high-intensity. This approach has gained popularity among runners for its effectiveness in improving performance while reducing the risk of overtraining and injury.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is the 80/20 Rule?</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  The 80/20 rule advocates for spending the majority of your training time at a low intensity, typically at an easy pace where you can maintain a conversation comfortably. The remaining 20% of your training time is devoted to higher-intensity workouts such as tempo runs, intervals, and hill repeats.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How Does the 80/20 Rule Benefit Runners?</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  By focusing the majority of your training on low-intensity runs, you build a strong aerobic base, improve endurance, and enhance fat burning. This approach allows you to accumulate more mileage without overstressing your body, reducing the risk of burnout and injury.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Implementing the 80/20 Rule in Your Training</h2>
                <div className="flex justify-between items-start mb-4">
                  <p className="mb-4 flex-1">
                    To apply the 80/20 rule to your training, track your training sessions and ensure that approximately 80% of your total training time is spent at low intensity. This can include easy runs, long slow distance (LSD) runs, and recovery runs. Reserve the remaining 20% for high-intensity workouts, focusing on quality over quantity.<br/>
                    Adopting the 80/20 rule helps in balancing your training load, reducing the risk of injury and burnout. This method ensures you build a solid aerobic base while still incorporating sessions that improve your speed and strength.<br/>
                    By maintaining this balance, athletes can experience sustainable progress and improvements in their overall performance.

                <p>
                  Consistency is key, and the 80/20 rule provides a framework that is both challenging and manageable. Over time, youâ€™ll notice enhanced endurance, faster recovery, and a higher level of fitness, allowing you to achieve your training goals more effectively.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Examples of 80/20 Training Sessions</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Here's an example of how you can structure your weekly training using the 80/20 rule:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                  <li>Monday: Easy 10 km run</li>
                  <li>Tuesday: Interval training (20% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                  <li>Wednesday: Rest or cross-training</li>
                  <li>Thursday: Tempo run or hill repeats (20% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                  <li>Friday: Easy 5 km run</li>
                  <li>Saturday: Long slow distance run (LSD) (approximately 80% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                  <li>Sunday: Rest or easy recovery run</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  By following the 80/20 rule, you can optimize your training to improve performance, enhance endurance, and reduce the risk of overtraining. Remember to listen to your body, adjust the intensity as needed, and enjoy the journey of becoming a stronger, more resilient runner.
