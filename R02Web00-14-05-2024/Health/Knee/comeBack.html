                <p class="mb-4">Recovering from a knee injury can be challenging, both physically and mentally. However, with the right approach and mindset, you can not only return to running but also become stronger than before. Here are seven tips to help you bounce back stronger after a knee injury:</p>

                <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 mb-4"> <!-- Changed to ordered list -->
                    <li><strong>Follow Your Rehab Plan:</strong> Adhere to your rehabilitation program diligently. Consistency is key to rebuilding strength and flexibility in your knee.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Slowly:</strong> Gradually reintroduce running into your routine, do not increase your mileage/time more than 10% per week. Begin with short, low-impact sessions and gradually increase duration and intensity over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to any signs of discomfort or pain during and after running. If you experience pain, reduce your activity level and consult with a healthcare professional if necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Strength Training:</strong> Incorporate strength training exercises, especially those targeting the muscles around the knee, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.</li>
