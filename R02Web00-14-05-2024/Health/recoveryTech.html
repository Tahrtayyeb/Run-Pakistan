                    <p class="mb-4">Recovery is an essential part of any runner's training regimen. Proper recovery techniques can help prevent injuries, reduce muscle soreness, and improve performance. Here are some effective recovery strategies for runners:</p>

                    <!-- First Recovery Technique -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. Rest and Active Recovery</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Rest is crucial for allowing muscles to repair and rebuild after intense workouts. Incorporating active recovery activities such as light jogging, swimming, or cycling can help increase blood flow and promote recovery without adding stress to fatigued muscles.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Second Recovery Technique -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        
                    </div>
                    <div class="mb-8 flex justify-center items-center mt-10 ">
                        <ul class="list-disc mb-4"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Stretching and Foam Rolling</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">Regular stretching and foam rolling can help release tension in muscles, improve flexibility, and reduce the risk of injury. Focus on stretching major muscle groups used during running, such as the calves, hamstrings, quadriceps, and hip flexors. After workout add stretching the schedule as it increases range of motion and decreases the risk of injury among runner. Incorporate weekly yoga session once a week.</p>

                    <!-- Third Recovery Technique -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. Hydration and Nutrition</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Proper hydration and nutrition are essential for replenishing electrolytes, glycogen stores, and repairing muscle tissue. Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day and consume a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.</p>

                    <!-- Fourth Recovery Technique -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        </div>

                        <ul class="list-disc mb-4">
                            
                            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. Sleep and Rest</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">Quality sleep is undeniably crucial for optimal recovery and efficient muscle repair processes. It's recommended to aim for a duration of 7 to 9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to provide your body with ample time to rest, rejuvenate, and recharge its energy stores. It is equally important to prioritize the creation of a sleep-conducive environment within your bedroom, ensuring it remains adequately dark, pleasantly quiet, and comfortably cool throughout the night.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Massage therapy and compression garments can help reduce muscle soreness, improve circulation, and accelerate recovery. Consider scheduling regular massages or using compression socks or sleeves to aid in post-run recovery.</p>
