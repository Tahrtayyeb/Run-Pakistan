                    <p class="mb-4">IT band syndrome, or iliotibial band syndrome, is a common injury among runners.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Symptoms of IT Band Syndrome</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The most common symptom of IT band syndrome is pain on the outside of the knee, especially when running or walking downhill. Other symptoms may include swelling, tenderness, or a clicking sensation in the knee joint.</p>
            
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Causes of IT Band Syndrome</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">IT band syndrome is often caused by overuse or repetitive motion, such as running long distances or cycling. Other factors that may contribute to IT band syndrome include improper footwear, muscle imbalances, or running on uneven surfaces.</p>
            
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Treatment and Prevention</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Treatment for IT band syndrome typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Physical therapy exercises to stretch and strengthen the IT band and surrounding muscles may also be beneficial. To prevent IT band syndrome, it's essential to gradually increase mileage, maintain proper running form, and incorporate strength training exercises into your routine.</p>
            
                    <p>By understanding the symptoms, causes, and treatment options for IT band syndrome, runners can take proactive measures to prevent and manage this common injury, allowing them to continue enjoying the sport with minimal discomfort.</p>
