                    <p class="mb-4">The Beijing half marathon, an event marked by athleticism and competition, now faces scrutiny over allegations that three African athletes deliberately allowed China's star runner He Jie to win Sunday's race.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Footage surfaced appearing to show Kenya's Robert Keter and Willy Mnangat, along with Ethiopia's Dejene Hailu, pointing to the line and slowing down before waving past He, 25.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Mnangat has stated that the trio ran as pacemakers, contracted to help He break the Chinese half-marathon record of one hour two minutes 33 seconds.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">However, He missed out on the record with a time of 1:03:44, one second ahead of the trio, who tied for second place.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A spokesperson at the Beijing Sports Bureau told AFP they were investigating the incident, adding: "We will announce the results to the public once they are available."</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Xstep, a Chinese sports brand who sponsored the event and have a contract with He, stated: "The situation is still being confirmed and verified by multiple parties. Further information will be communicated as soon as possible."</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">China's He won marathon gold at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou and is his country's record holder for the full marathon.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">A statement from World Athletics to BBC Sport said: "We are aware of the footage circulating online from the Beijing half marathon this weekend and understand an investigation is currently being conducted by the relevant local authorities."</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Users of Chinese social media site Weibo have posted about the race, with a comment saying "this is no doubt the most embarrassing title of He Jie's career" receiving more than 1,000 likes.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Another post added: "With such a major organiser and such a well-known event, this really pushes sportsmanship to the ground in shame."</p>
