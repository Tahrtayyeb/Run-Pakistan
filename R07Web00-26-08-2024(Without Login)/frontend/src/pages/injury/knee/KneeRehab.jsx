                <p className="mb-4">
                  To effectively rehabilitate the knee, it's crucial to understand its complex anatomy and the most common injuries:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Knee Anatomy:</strong> The knee joint consists of the femur, tibia, patella, crucial ligaments (ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL), menisci, and various muscles and tendons.</li>
                  <li><strong>Common Injuries:</strong> Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears, meniscus injuries, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and osteoarthritis frequently require targeted rehabilitation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  A systematic review published in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy emphasizes the importance of tailored rehabilitation programs based on specific injuries and individual patient factors [1].

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Principles of Effective Knee Rehabilitation</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Successful knee rehabilitation is guided by several key principles, supported by robust scientific evidence:
                </p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 mb-4">
                  <li><strong>Progressive Loading:</strong> Gradually increasing the load on the knee joint and surrounding tissues stimulates healing and adaptation. A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that progressive loading protocols significantly improved outcomes in ACL reconstruction patients [2].</li>
                  <li><strong>Neuromuscular Control:</strong> Enhancing the coordination between the nervous system and muscles is crucial for joint stability and function. Research in the American Journal of Sports Medicine demonstrated that neuromuscular training reduces the risk of secondary ACL injuries by up to 50% [3].</li>
                  <li><strong>Functional Exercise Progression:</strong> Advancing from isolated muscle exercises to complex, functional movements mimics daily activities and sport-specific tasks. A randomized controlled trial in Physical Therapy showed that functional progression leads to better outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis [4].</li>
                  <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Utilizing appropriate pain management strategies facilitates exercise engagement and optimizes recovery. A meta-analysis in the Clinical Journal of Pain found that multi-modal pain management approaches significantly improve rehabilitation outcomes [5].</li>

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Strengthening the muscles surrounding the knee is crucial for providing support, stability, and optimal function. The following exercises are backed by scientific research for their effectiveness in knee rehabilitation:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Quad Sets:</strong> A fundamental exercise for activating and strengthening the quadriceps muscles.
                    <br />
                    <em>Technique:</em> Sit or lie down with your legs extended. Tighten the quadriceps muscles of the affected leg, pressing the back of your knee into the floor. Hold for 5-10 seconds, then relax. Repeat 10-15 times, 2-3 sets.
                    <br />
                    <em>Evidence:</em> A randomized controlled trial in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy found that quad sets significantly improve quadriceps activation and strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis, with a 22% increase in muscle strength after 8 weeks of training [6].
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Straight Leg Raises:</strong> Targets the quadriceps while minimizing stress on the knee joint.
                    <br />
                    <em>Technique:</em> Lie on your back with one leg bent and the other straight. Lift the straight leg off the ground to the height of the opposite knee, keeping it straight. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then lower slowly. Perform 10-15 repetitions, 2-3 sets.
                    <br />
                    <em>Evidence:</em> A systematic review published in Clinical Rehabilitation demonstrated that straight leg raises are effective in improving quadriceps strength and reducing pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome, with an average pain reduction of 43% after a 6-week program [7].
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Hamstring Curls:</strong> Essential for balanced knee strength and stability.
                    <br />
                    <em>Technique:</em> Lie face down or stand holding onto a support. Bend your knee, bringing your heel towards your buttocks. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then lower slowly. Perform 10-15 repetitions, 2-3 sets.
                    <br />
                    <em>Evidence:</em> Research in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found that incorporating hamstring curls in ACL rehabilitation programs resulted in a 31% reduction in re-injury rates compared to quadriceps-focused programs alone [8].
