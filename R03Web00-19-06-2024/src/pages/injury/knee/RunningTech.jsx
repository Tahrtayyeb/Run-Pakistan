                  Proper Running Techniques to Reduce Knee Impact
                </h1>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Running is a high-impact activity that can put stress on your
                  knees, leading to discomfort and potential injuries. By
                  adopting proper running techniques, you can reduce the impact
                  on your knees and lower the risk of knee-related issues. Here
                  are some techniques to help you run with less knee impact:
                </p>

                {/* First Running Technique */}
                <div className="mb-8">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                    1. Maintain Proper Posture
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and head facing
                    forward. Avoid leaning too far forward or backward, as this
                    can increase strain on your knees.
                  </p>
                </div>

                {/* Second Running Technique */}
                <div className="mb-8">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. Land Softly</h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Focus on landing softly with each step to reduce the impact
                    on your knees. Aim for a midfoot or forefoot strike rather
                    than striking with your heel, which can send shock waves up
                    your legs.
                  </p>
                </div>

                {/* Third Running Technique */}
                <div className="mb-8">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                    3. Increase Cadence
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Try to increase your cadence (steps per minute) to reduce
                    the force of each foot strike. Shortening your stride and
                    taking quicker, lighter steps can help decrease the impact
                    on your knees.
                  </p>
                </div>

                {/* Fourth Running Technique */}
                <div className="mb-8">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                    4. Strengthen Your Muscles
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine,
                    focusing on muscles that support your knees such as the
                    quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Strong muscles provide
                    better stability and protection for your knees.
                  </p>
                </div>

                {/* Fifth Running Technique */}
                <div className="mb-8">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                    5. Listen to Your Body
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Pay attention to any discomfort or pain in your knees while
                    running. If you experience persistent pain, reduce your
                    mileage or take a break from running to allow your knees to
                    recover.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                  By incorporating these proper running techniques into your
                  training routine, you can help minimize knee impact and enjoy
                  a safer, more comfortable running experience.
                </p>
