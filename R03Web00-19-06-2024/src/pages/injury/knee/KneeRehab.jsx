                  Strengthening Exercises
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Strengthening the muscles surrounding the knee is crucial for
                  providing support and stability to the joint. Here are some
                  effective knee rehab exercises for strengthening:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Quad Sets:</strong> Sit or lie down with your legs
                    extended. Tighten the quadriceps muscles of the affected leg
                    and hold for a few seconds. Relax and repeat.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Straight Leg Raises:</strong> Lie on your back with
                    one leg bent and the other straight. Lift the straight leg
                    off the ground, keeping it straight, and hold for a few
                    seconds before lowering it back down.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Hamstring Curls:</strong> Using a resistance band or
                    cable machine, anchor one end and attach the other end to
                    your ankle. Flex your knee, bringing your heel towards your
                    buttocks, then slowly return to the starting position.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Step-ups:</strong> Stand in front of a step or
                    platform. Step onto the platform with the affected leg, then
                    lower yourself back down. Repeat for several repetitions.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4">
                  Perform these exercises with proper form and technique,
                  gradually increasing resistance and repetitions as your
                  strength improves.
                </p>

              <div className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Rest and Recovery</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In addition to exercises, proper rest and recovery are
                  essential for allowing the body to heal and rebuild tissues.
                  Avoid high-impact activities that exacerbate knee pain, and
                  incorporate rest days into your routine to prevent overuse
                  injuries.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                  Listen to your body, and if you experience persistent or
                  worsening knee pain, consult with a healthcare professional
                  for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment
                  plan.

                    <strong>Calf Stretch:</strong> Stand facing a wall with one
