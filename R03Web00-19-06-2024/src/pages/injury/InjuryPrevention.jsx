              <div className="w-full md:w-1/2 pr-4 mb-4 md:mb-0">
                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Gradual Progression</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Avoid sudden increases in mileage or intensity. Gradually build up your mileage and pace to allow your body to adapt and reduce the risk of overuse injuries.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Proper Footwear</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Invest in good-quality running shoes that provide adequate support and cushioning for your foot type and running style. Replace your shoes regularly to prevent wear and tear.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Cross-Training</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Incorporate cross-training activities like swimming, cycling, or yoga into your routine to improve overall fitness, strengthen different muscle groups, and reduce the risk of overuse injuries.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Listen to Your Body</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Pay attention to any warning signs of injury, such as persistent pain, discomfort, or fatigue. Rest when needed, and don't push through pain during workouts.</p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">5. Proper Nutrition and Hydration</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">Fuel your body with a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support your training and recovery. Stay hydrated before, during, and after your runs to maintain optimal performance and prevent cramps.</p>

                <p>By incorporating these injury prevention tips into your running routine, you can enjoy the many benefits of running while minimizing the risk of injuries. Remember to prioritize safety and listen to your body to ensure a long and fulfilling running journey.</p>
