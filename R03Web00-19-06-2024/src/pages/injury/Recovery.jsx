                Effective Recovery Techniques for Runners
              </h1>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Recovery is an essential part of any runner's training regimen.
                Proper recovery techniques can help prevent injuries, reduce
                muscle soreness, and improve performance. Here are some
                effective recovery strategies for runners:
              </p>

              <div className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                  1. Rest and Active Recovery
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Rest is crucial for allowing muscles to repair and rebuild
                  after intense workouts. Incorporating active recovery
                  activities such as light jogging, swimming, or cycling can
                  help increase blood flow and promote recovery without adding
                  stress to fatigued muscles.

                <ul className="list-disc mb-4">
                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                    2. Stretching and Foam Rolling
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Regular stretching and foam rolling can help release tension
                    in muscles, improve flexibility, and reduce the risk of
                    injury. Focus on stretching major muscle groups used during
                    running, such as the calves, hamstrings, quadriceps, and hip
                    flexors. After workout add stretching the schedule as it
                    increases range of motion and decreases the risk of injury
                    among runner. Incorporate weekly yoga session once a week.

                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Proper hydration and nutrition are essential for replenishing
                  electrolytes, glycogen stores, and repairing muscle tissue.
                  Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day and consume a
                  balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, protein, and healthy
                  fats.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Quality sleep is undeniably crucial for optimal recovery and
                    efficient muscle repair processes. It's recommended to aim
                    for a duration of 7 to 9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each
                    night to provide your body with ample time to rest,
                    rejuvenate, and recharge its energy stores. It is equally
                    important to prioritize the creation of a sleep-conducive
                    environment within your bedroom, ensuring it remains
                    adequately dark, pleasantly quiet, and comfortably cool
                    throughout the night.

                  5. Massage and Compression Therapy
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Massage therapy and compression garments can help reduce
                  muscle soreness, improve circulation, and accelerate recovery.
                  Consider scheduling regular massages or using compression
                  socks or sleeves to aid in post-run recovery.
