                Record Breaking Barkley Marathon & Jasmine Paris Historic Finish
              </h1>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Barkley Marathons, renowned for its brutal terrain, mobile phones & GPS trackers are not allowed, and no regular course marking, and strict time limits, witnessed an extraordinary moment in 2024 as Jasmine Paris, hailing from the U.K., etched her name in history by becoming the first woman to conquer the unforgiving course. Since 1989, no women and only 17 men were able to finish the Barkley Marathon.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The 2024 Barkley Marathons has drawn to a close just outside Wartburg, Tennessee, marking a historic milestone with five runners completing this year's grueling course. Jasmine Paris ran over 100 miles with tendonitis in her one knee, crossing the finish line 99 seconds prior to the 60-hour cutoff time.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                It was Jasmine Paris's third attempt to conquer this marathon by running over 100 miles with an elevation gain of 63,000 feet - which is equivalent to summitting Mount Everest twice. She had a list of injuries during her race, including swollen feet, tendonitis in one knee only, nails coming off, and lack of sleep, which made the journey more difficult, but her strong will allowed her to continue.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                During an interview with CNN Sports, she said:
                <blockquote>
                  “All I could do was breathe and that’s all my body was screaming out for: lie down and breathe.”
                </blockquote>
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                “That final kilometer was the first point, I think, where I actually started to doubt that I was going to make it. I did believe in myself until that point and then suddenly I was like, ‘It’s going to be really down to the wire.’”
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                “I felt like I couldn’t go any faster and yet somehow managed to pull it out of the bag and somehow did push myself almost into a sprint on that final bit of hill when everything in me was so desperate to stop.”
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In the men's division, Ihor Verys from Ukraine, now residing in Canada, claimed the top spot, followed by John Kelly from the U.S. in second place, Jared Campbell also from the U.S. in third place, and Greig Hamilton representing New Zealand in fourth place. With a remarkable three finishers in the previous year, the race director, Gary Cantrell, known as Lazarus Lake, undoubtedly raised the stakes, pushing the limits of the approximately 26-mile loop to new heights.

                Jasmine Paris's historic finish at the Barkley Marathon 2024 will be remembered as a watershed moment in the sport. Her courage, tenacity, and indomitable spirit serve as a beacon of hope for all who dare to defy the odds and embrace the extraordinary.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In an interview with The Guardian, she said: "I was so close to passing out. I felt I was going to reach the finishing gate, or collapse right in front of it. There was a tunnel of roars on either side. But I couldn’t focus. It was all a bit blurry."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When asked about her training regimen, she told The Guardian: "The most I ran was 90 miles a week, but probably with the walking it was more like 120 or 130 miles,” she says. “In terms of practicing for the ascent, I also did 11,000 to 12,000 meters some weeks from hill reps or the stair climber."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As the running world celebrates Jasmine's monumental achievement, her journey stands as a testament to the power of perseverance and the boundless possibilities that await those who dare to chase their dreams.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Jasmine's victory not only highlights the remarkable progress of women in ultrarunning but also underscores the evolving nature of the sport itself. With each passing year, the Barkley Marathon continues to test the limits of human endurance, pushing athletes to new heights of physical and mental fortitude.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As we reflect on Jasmine's historic triumph, let us not forget the collective effort and dedication of all participants who braved the challenges of the Barkley course. Their resilience and determination serve as a source of inspiration for runners around the world, reminding us that with perseverance and courage, any obstacle can be overcome.
