                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The 80/20 Rule for Runners</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">The 80/20 rule is a training principle that suggests dividing your training intensity into two main zones: 80% low-intensity and 20% high-intensity. This approach has gained popularity among runners for its effectiveness in improving performance while reducing the risk of overtraining and injury.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is the 80/20 Rule?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The 80/20 rule advocates for spending the majority of your training time at a low intensity, typically at an easy pace where you can maintain a conversation comfortably. The remaining 20% of your training time is devoted to higher-intensity workouts such as tempo runs, intervals, and hill repeats.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How Does the 80/20 Rule Benefit Runners?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">By focusing the majority of your training on low-intensity runs, you build a strong aerobic base, improve endurance, and enhance fat burning. This approach allows you to accumulate more mileage without overstressing your body, reducing the risk of burnout and injury.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Implementing the 80/20 Rule in Your Training</h2>
                    <div class="flex justify-center mb-4"> <!-- Flex container for images -->
                        <img src="/dist/images/8020.jpeg" alt="80/20" class="rounded-lg mr-4"  style="height: 400px">
                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">To apply the 80/20 rule to your training, track your training sessions and ensure that approximately 80% of your total training time is spent at low intensity. This can include easy runs, long slow distance (LSD) runs, and recovery runs. Reserve the remaining 20% for high-intensity workouts, focusing on quality over quantity.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Examples of 80/20 Training Sessions</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Here's an example of how you can structure your weekly training using the 80/20 rule:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                        <li>Monday: Easy 10 km run</li>
                        <li>Tuesday: Interval training (20% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                        <li>Wednesday: Rest or cross-training</li>
                        <li>Thursday: Tempo run or hill repeats (20% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                        <li>Friday: Easy 5 km run</li>
                        <li>Saturday: Long slow distance run (LSD) (approximately 80% of total weekly mileage)</li>
                        <li>Sunday: Rest or easy recovery run</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">By following the 80/20 rule, you can optimize your training to improve performance, enhance endurance, and reduce the risk of overtraining. Remember to listen to your body, adjust the intensity as needed, and enjoy the journey of becoming a stronger, more resilient runner.</p>
