                    <p class="mb-4">Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in the performance, recovery, and overall health of runners. Here's why nutrition is important for runners and some key guidelines to follow:</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600"></p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Nutrition for Performance</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Fueling your body with the right nutrients before, during, and after runs can enhance performance and endurance. Carbohydrates provide energy for running, while protein supports muscle repair and growth. Hydration is also essential to maintain optimal performance.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Recovery Nutrition</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">After a run, it's crucial to replenish glycogen stores and repair muscle tissue. Consuming a combination of carbohydrates and protein within the first 30 minutes to an hour post-run can promote faster recovery and reduce muscle soreness.</p>

                        <li>Include healthy fats from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil for sustained energy.</li>
