                    <p class="mb-4">Knee injuries and conditions can significantly impact mobility and quality of life. Whether recovering from an injury or managing chronic knee issues, incorporating targeted rehabilitation exercises into your routine can help strengthen the muscles around the knee joint, improve stability, and promote overall mobility.</p>

                    <!-- Strengthening Exercises -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Strengthening Exercises</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Strengthening the muscles surrounding the knee is crucial for providing support and stability to the joint. Here are some effective knee rehab exercises for strengthening:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                            <li><strong>Quad Sets:</strong> Sit or lie down with your legs extended. Tighten the quadriceps muscles of the affected leg and hold for a few seconds. Relax and repeat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Straight Leg Raises:</strong> Lie on your back with one leg bent and the other straight. Lift the straight leg off the ground, keeping it straight, and hold for a few seconds before lowering it back down.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hamstring Curls:</strong> Using a resistance band or cable machine, anchor one end and attach the other end to your ankle. Flex your knee, bringing your heel towards your buttocks, then slowly return to the starting position.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step-ups:</strong> Stand in front of a step or platform. Step onto the platform with the affected leg, then lower yourself back down. Repeat for several repetitions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-4">Perform these exercises with proper form and technique, gradually increasing resistance and repetitions as your strength improves.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Flexibility and Mobility Exercises -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Flexibility and Mobility Exercises</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">Improving flexibility and mobility in the knee joint can help reduce stiffness and discomfort. Incorporate these exercises into your routine:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
                            <li><strong>Hamstring Stretch:</strong> Sit on the floor with one leg extended and the other bent. Reach towards your toes on the extended leg, feeling a stretch in the back of the thigh. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quad Stretch:</strong> Stand with one hand against a wall for balance. Grab your ankle with the hand on the same side and pull your heel towards your buttocks, feeling a stretch in the front of the thigh. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.</li>
                            <li><strong>Calf Stretch:</strong> Stand facing a wall with one foot forward and one foot back. Lean forward, keeping your back heel on the ground, until you feel a stretch in the calf of the back leg. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-4">Perform these stretches gently, avoiding any movements that cause pain. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and repeat several times on each side.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Rest and Recovery -->
                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Rest and Recovery</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">In addition to exercises, proper rest and recovery are essential for allowing the body to heal and rebuild tissues. Avoid high-impact activities that exacerbate knee pain, and incorporate rest days into your routine to prevent overuse injuries.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4">Listen to your body, and if you experience persistent or worsening knee pain, consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>By incorporating these effective knee rehab exercises into your routine, you can strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee joint, improve flexibility and mobility, and optimize your overall function and quality of life.</p>
