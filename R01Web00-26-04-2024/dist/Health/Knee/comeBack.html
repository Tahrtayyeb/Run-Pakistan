                    <li><strong>Follow Your Rehab Plan:</strong> Adhere to your rehabilitation program diligently. Consistency is key to rebuilding strength and flexibility in your knee.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Slowly:</strong> Gradually reintroduce running into your routine. Begin with short, low-impact sessions and gradually increase duration and intensity over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to any signs of discomfort or pain during and after running. If you experience pain, reduce your activity level and consult with a healthcare professional if necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Strength Training:</strong> Incorporate strength training exercises, especially those targeting the muscles around the knee, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work on Flexibility:</strong> Perform regular stretching exercises to improve flexibility and range of motion in your knee joint. Yoga and Pilates can also be beneficial.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Patient:</strong> Recovery takes time, so be patient with yourself. Celebrate small victories along the way and trust the process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Professional Guidance:</strong> Consider working with a physical therapist or coach who specializes in sports rehabilitation. They can provide personalized guidance and support throughout your recovery journey.</li>
