                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">A Historic Finish</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The 2024 Barkley Marathons has drawn to a close just outside Wartburg, Tennessee, marking a historic milestone with five runners completing this year's grueling course. Jasmin Paris of the U.K. etched her name in the annals of sports history by becoming the first woman ever to conquer the event, crossing the finish line in an impressive time of 59 hours, 58 minutes, and 21 seconds.

                        In the men's division, Ihor Verys from Ukraine, now residing in Canada, claimed the top spot, followed by John Kelly from the U.S. in second place, Jared Campbell also from the U.S. in third place, and Greig Hamilton representing New Zealand in fourth place. With a remarkable three finishers in the previous year, the race director, Gary Cantrell, known as Lazarus Lake, undoubtedly raised the stakes, pushing the limits of the approximately 26-mile loop to new heights.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Jasmine's Journey</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The Barkley Marathons is renowned for its daunting course, characterized by its off-trail terrain and staggering elevation gain. Covering an estimated distance of around 130 miles with an astonishing 63,000 feet of elevation gain, the race presents a formidable challenge to even the most seasoned ultrarunners. However, the exact measurements of the course remain a mystery, known only to the race director, Gary Cantrell, also known as Lazarus Lake. This secrecy adds to the mystique and allure of the event. 
                        One distinctive feature of the Barkley Marathons is the absence of GPS watches and spectators on the course. This intentional restriction enhances the race's difficulty, forcing participants to rely solely on their navigational skills and mental fortitude to navigate the rugged terrain. Without the aid of modern technology, runners must trust their instincts and follow the cryptic trail markers scattered throughout the course.</p>
